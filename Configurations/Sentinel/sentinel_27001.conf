# port used by this sentinel

port 27001

# tells sentinel which RDB to monitor
# sentinel monitor <master-name> <ip> <redis-port> <quorum>
# quorum is the number of sentinels that need to detect 
# fallen master in order to initialte faillover (O_DOWN state)

sentinel monitor myredisdb 127.0.0.1 7000 2

# number of milliseconds the master should
# be unreachable in order to assert S_DOWN state to it
# time is in milliseconds (default 30s)

sentinel down-after-milliseconds myredisdb 10000

# number of replicas that can be reconfigured simultaneously.
# during reconfiguration redis node wont answer to queries.

sentinel parallel-syncs myredisdb 1

# specifies the failover timeout in milliseconds.
# specifies the time frame in which new master must be elected.
# if this is not the case, failover is not considered successfull
# and will be retried by another sentinel.
# specifies time frame in which all replicas must be reconfigured
# to do replication from the new master. if this is not the case, 
# replicas are force to reconfigure immediately no matter 
# parallel-syncs value.
