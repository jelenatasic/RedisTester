################################ NETWORK CONFIGURATION ########################

# port used by this redis node

port 8003

# closes connection after N seconds
# set zero to disable

timeout 0

################################# REPLICATION #################################

# by default this node is not configured as slave
# if it's going to be reconfigured as slave at some point
# it's configured to return stale data to clients

slave-serve-stale-data yes

# size of buffer that is populated with data that needs to be replicated
# this buffer allows partial resync after slave has been disconected
# the longer the buffer, longer time slave can be disconected
# buffer is allocated only when there is connected slave

repl-backlog-size 1mb

################################ SECURITY #####################################

# forces us to use authentification when bind is not specified
# redis node can be accessed from anywhere if bind is missing
# so this is the way to force protection
# default value

protected-mode yes

# by default this is master node and it requires authentification

requirepass password321

# if events lead to master node being demoted to slave
# it will use the password to authenticate with new master

masterauth password321

################################ REDIS LOG ####################################

# specifies the level of information logged
# debug level is used for debugging and testing
# verbose is not as much as debug messy
# it logs everything

################################ SNAPSHOTTING  ################################

# database snapshotting rules:
# save <seconds> <changes>
# after 900 sec if at least 1 key changed
# after 180 sec if at least 10 keys changed
# after 60 sec if at least 5000 keys changed

save 900 1
save 180 10
save 60 5000

# stop accepting writes if snapshot fails

stop-writes-on-bgsave-error yes

# uses LZF compression for strings before DB dump

rdbcompression yes

# when set to yes rdbchecksum forces checksum calculation
# for RDB dump
# has performance toll about 10% so it is disabled

rdbchecksum no

# dbfilename - the filename of the dump for DB
# dir - the directory where to dump will be placed

dbfilename redis8003.rdb
dir /home/redis/cluster/RDB

################################ REDIS CLUSTER  ###############################

# enable cluster mode

cluster-enabled yes

# cluster node configuration file. this file is not
# intended to be edited by hand. 
# it is created and updated by Redis nodes.

# cluster-config-file /home/redis/cluster/clusterconfig/nodes8003.conf

# cluster node timeout is the amount of milliseconds a node must be unreachable
# for it to be considered in failure state.

cluster-node-timeout 10000

# cluster replicas are able to migrate to orphaned masters
# this improves the cluster ability to resist failures

cluster-migration-barrier 1

# by default Redis Cluster nodes stop accepting queries
# if they detect there is at least an hash slot uncovered

cluster-require-full-coverage yes

############################## MEMORY MANAGEMENT ################################

# it is possible to set maximum memory used by RDB

maxmemory 1gb

# when allowed memory is filed up
# depending on evicition policy, keys are removed from database
# if there is no kay that can be removed error is returned
# when write request is made
# evicition policies can be based on LRU, LFU, random or noeviction
# maxmemory-policy allkeys-random

maxmemory-policy noeviction

################################## SLOW LOG ###################################

# show log logs commands that executed longer then slowlog-log-slower-than
# time is expressed in microseconds
# default 0.01 ms

slowlog-log-slower-than 10000

# show log is persisted in memory, so to access it, you have to query RDB
# number of commands persisted in show log is:

slowlog-max-len 128

################################ LATENCY MONITOR ##############################

# the system logs operations that were performed in a time equal or
# greater than the amount of milliseconds specified via latency-monitor-threshold.
# if set to zero, the latency monitor is turned off.
# collecting data has a performance impact, that while very small, 
# can be measured under big load.
# via the LATENCY command this information is available to the user.
# will use this option to mesure latency in some point of testing
